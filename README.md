# Predictive-Modeling-of-Signal-Peptides-in-Protein-Sequences
This project uses machine learning to predict signal peptides in protein sequences. It features data normalization, SVM-based classification, and cross-validation to ensure reliable signal peptide detection, creating a streamlined, effective prediction pipeline


Machine Learning Project for Sequence Analysis

Overview

This project is a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for analyzing biological sequences. It involves loading data, normalizing and scaling features, extracting relevant features, training an SVM model, testing the model, and evaluating its performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The key components of the project include:

Loading Data: Reading and preprocessing data from .tsv files containing biological sequence data.

Data Normalization: Normalizing the dataset to prepare it for modeling.

Feature Extraction: Extracting features from sequence data using vectorization.

Model Training: Training an SVM model with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

Model Testing: Testing the model on a separate test dataset.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using multiple metrics.

Project Details

Data

The dataset consists of positive and negative sequences saved in .tsv files.

Positive sequences contain known features such as cleavage sites, while negative sequences do not.

Model

The project uses an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model for classification.

Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are used to optimize the model performance.

Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a detailed classification report.
